		<h1>Low Self-esteem</h1>
		<strong>"...those suffering with
        low self-esteem are at a higher risk for drug and
        alcohol abuse, and tobacco use </strong>(Crump et al., 1997;
        Jones and Heaven, 1998)<br><br>
	
		<strong>"Self-esteem is associated with a broad range of
        mental disorders and social problems, both
        internalizing problems (e.g. depression, suicidal
        tendencies, eating disorders and anxiety) and
        externalizing problems (e.g. violence and substance abuse"</strong>(Mann et al, 2004)

		<h1>Letter to a<br>
		Friend.</h1><br>


		
		Long after he co-founded Alcoholics Anonymous, and many years into his sobriety even Bill Wilson
		 would come to realize although his mystical leap of faith had saved him, it only masked deep psychological
		  vaunerabilites that had never been addressed.
		  In a<a href="https://barricks.com/AASayings/emotional.html"> letter </a> to a friend and in desperation 
		  to help, he would honestly reveal his unhealthy dependencies:
		<br><br>       
		<strong>"...Suddenly, I realized what the matter was. My basic flaw had always been dependence, almost absolute
			 dependence, on people or circumstances to supply me with prestige, security, and the like. Failing to get these
			  things according to my perfectionist dreams and specifications, I had fought for them. And when defeat came,
			   so did my depression."<br><br>
		</strong>Bill Wilson "Emotional Sobriety"
