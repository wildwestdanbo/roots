           <p> This crisis has underscored the urgent need for innovative and effective solutions.
             Traditional treatment models, while they have served us in the past, are now struggling to combat the scale and complexity of this issue.
            The loss of life has been staggering and unacceptable.

            <p>             
              Our mission is to introduce a dynamic, modern approach to addiction treatment.
               We believe that by leveraging cutting-edge technology and evidence-based practices, we can offer a more robust response to this crisis.
                Join us as we strive to turn the tide on the opioid epidemic one life at a time.

              Self-esteem, in particular low self-esteem, has been proven to be a main component of addiction. Since most of us experience low self-esteem
              at times, how can we avoid being pulled into addictive behaviours?

              Our cognitions of ourselves and our self-talk affect our self-esteem. One 
              strategy that has been proven to help change internal perceptions is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, a form of psychotherapy you can learn to
              do yourself or have a professional help you with. "In fact, itâ€™s estimated that roughly 85% of people worldwide (adults and adolescents) have
              low self-esteem."
